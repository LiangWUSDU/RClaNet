""" Function for an automatic Leave-One-Out Validation of the Neural Network model by
    running the whole pipeline once by training on the complete data set except one sample
    and then predict the segmentation of the last remaining sample.

Args:
    sample_list (list of indices):          A list of sample indicies which will be used for validation.
    model (Neural Network model):           Instance of a Neural Network model class instance.
    epochs (integer):                       Number of epochs. A single epoch is defined as one iteration through the complete data set.
    iterations (integer):                   Number of iterations (batches) in a single epoch.
    evaluation_path (string):               Path to the evaluation data directory. This directory will be created and
                                            used for storing all kinds of evaluation results during the validation processes.
